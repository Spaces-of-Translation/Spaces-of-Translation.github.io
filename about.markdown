Our project studies a small constellation of literary and cultural magazines from
three countries (Britain, France, Germany) in order to consider how, through
translation, they explore and construct notions of European identity in the period
following from the end of World War Two to the mid-1960s. Rapid shifts towards
decolonisation, the Americanisation of European culture, the rise of anti-militarism
and the strategic and ideological conflicts instigated by the Cold War all stimulated
an ongoing reassessment of what the European idea stood for and whether or how it
might be achieved. Using the notion of periodicals as ‘European spaces’ the project
addresses the following research question: how does periodical culture in Britain,
France, and Germany use translation to reconfigure a vision for Europe after the
catastrophe of World War Two?
